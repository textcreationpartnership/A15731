            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>6 And this we doe, as willing to vſe al poſſible means<note place="margin">Hoping that our endeuour wil be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to many; being neceſſary for the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the more manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of truth.</note> to ſatisfie al: truſting, that as our endeuour ſemeth neceſſary for thoſe which wil admitte none other kind of trial, and for their better information, which think that we preferre any other authoritie before the holy Scriptures: ſo it may be alſo profitable to many, as being expedient for the more manifeſtation of truth (which can neuer be too much knowen) &amp; muſt nedes be wel accepted of our aduerſaries, who ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prouoke vs to this onely trial; bearing the world in hand, that therein they haue great aduauntage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Here therfore, beloued aduerſaries, to the more honour of god, and benefite of ſoules, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that you and we may be the ſooner accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to our mutual comforth, &amp; for the neceſſarie reduction vnto truth, of whoſoeuer are preſently in errour, we doe agree to encounter you, not onely <hi>principally,</hi> as we haue continually done, but alſo with the <hi>onely</hi> ſhort and ſharpe weapon of the ſacred Textes<note place="margin">We require reaſonable conditions.</note> of gods word, writen in the holy Bible of the old &amp; new Teſtament.

And therfore if our aduerſaries wil vſe others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, they muſt admit the like againſt them ſelues.</note>
            </p>
            <p>7 As firſt of al, it is ſtil to be remembred, that albeit we thus condeſcend to encounter you, by only holy Scriptures; yet we doe not therby graunt your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of other proofes to be iuſt or lawful. For we doe hold it certaine, that al Chriſtian Doctrine, can not be expreſly, and withal immediatly proued by holy Scriptures only; &amp; that other proofes are both neceſſary, &amp; authentical, as we doe vndertake (in due<note place="margin">Article 3. 41. 42.</note> places of this work) to proue, by the expreſſe written

And therefore we wil in this caſe agree, that you may if you can, either produce approued Traditions, Definitions of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Councels, Popes Decrees, Vniforme conſent of the auncient Fathers and Doctors, General practiſe of the viſible knowen Church, or any other ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial proofe, &amp; that you may alledge the cleare iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eccleſiaſtical Interpreters, of any holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt vs; ſo that you wil allow vs to vſe the ſame meanes, that each of vs may indifferently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelues, and aſſault the others, with the ſame kindes of defenſiue, and offenſiue, armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
            <p>8 In the meane while, ſo long as you wil needes try<note place="margin">2. Whiles our aduerſaries wil admit noe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe but onlie holie Scriptures; they muſt alſo be limited ther vnto.</note> this cauſe by the only holy Scriptures, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this ſecond condition, that ſeeing we refraine for your contentment, from other proofes; you muſt alſo be bound and limited to the ſame. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is vnreaſonable, &amp; ouer partial dealing, that whatſoeuer you find in any authentical Councel, Popes decree, auncient Father, or Catholique Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which may ſeeme to make for you, or againſt vs; ſhould by and by, be taken for a wounding blow ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vs, and neither the ſame, when it is rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed, nor the like, muſt touch you at al.

For that in al reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pleas, eſpecially in religious cauſes, the more cleare textes, ought to illuſtrate the more obſcure.</p>
            <p>In caſe alſo that anie wordes or paſſages, may ſeme cleare to one partie, and obſcure to the other, then doth reaſon dictate, to reaſonable perſons, to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of truth, and ſtudious of concord, that the moe<note place="margin">Or the fewer, by the more in number, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that al are true.</note> places in number, being, or ſeming, of like perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, of obſcuritie, may iuſtlie preuaile to expl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate the fewer: Stil conſidering, that al and euerie parcel of holy Scripture, is abſolutlie true, whether we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20968:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> it or no; al being indited by the holie Ghoſt, the Spirit of truth.</p>
            <p>11 Behold theſe are the conditions, which ſeme both<note place="margin">The holy Bible is ſet forth in Engliſh, and this booke is alſo written, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare which Religion is beſt grounded in holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> reaſonable and requiſite in this kinde of trial, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for their contentment, that deſire to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who amongſt diuers pretenders of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are beſt grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the holie Scriptures. For whoſe ſakes alſo, &amp; for this verie purpoſe, the whole ſacred Bible faithfully tranſlated into engliſh, is late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth, with annotations, gathered eſpecially out of the commentaries, and other writinges of the auncient Fathers, and Doctors of the Church.</p>
            <p>And now this work is compiled more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the diuine textes; agreable indeede, to the ſame holie Fathers ſenſe and beleefe: but ſo connecting manie concordant places, pertayning to the ſame pointes of doctrine, though not al that might be brought (for that would be too immenſe) yet ſo much as may abundantly ſuffice, aſwel for deciſion of the cheifeſt controuerſies, of theſe times, as alſo for confirmation of moſt other principal articles, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine miſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries of faith and Religion.<note place="margin">The Summe of al Chriſtian doctrine is here proued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe manie pointes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles.</note>
            </p>
            <p>12 Our reaſons, why in this maner, we proue the whole Catholique doctrine, not onlie in matters at this time in controuerſie, but alſo in ſuch others as haue bene in former ages, or may be in future, drawne into queſtion, are eſpecially theſe three. Firſt becauſe there is ſuch connexion amongſt manie partes of faith and Religion, that diuers which are or haue bene, called into controuerſie, can not be ſully declared, without preſuppoſed knowledg of other groundes, whereon they depend. For example, it behoueth al men, firſt to beleue, that God is one in ſubſtance, and three in perſons, before they can be wel inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that according to the Catholique faith, al the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20968:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> three diuine perſons, are conſubſtantial, and coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. Likewiſe except we firſt confeſſe, that God is omnipotent, it wil be hard or impoſſible to beleue miracles. So we muſt beleue that there is a Church, els we can not know what proprieties, priuiledges, and power it haith. And ſo in many other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, it auaileth much, to ſee the proofes of that which is confeſſed, becauſe by the ſame oftentimes, that which is denied, may either wholly, or in ſome part be proued, and explaned.</p>
            <p>13 Secondly we conſider, that as we are preſently<note place="margin">Secondlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe new er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are ſtil deuiſed.</note> encombred with the controuerſies raiſed by Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Zninglius, Cranmer, Caluin, Knox, Cartwright, and daily by new, and newer ſectaries: ſo we may hereafter (we know not how ſoone) be put to proue, any other part of Chriſtian Religion, not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. And therefore it ſhal be good, to ſee ſome groundes in the holy Scriptures, of al the principal pointes of our faith.</p>
            <p>14 Thirdly by this general proofe, of al Chriſtian<note place="margin">Thirdly to ſhew that old hereſies had as great pretence of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as anie new doctrine now haith.</note> doctrine, the diligent Reader may ſee, that manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greateſt miſteries, which our preſent aduerſaries acknowledg to be true and certaine, are as hard to be proued by expreſſe canonical Scripture, as any of thoſe which they deny. Yea I dare auouch, that the holie Scriptures, doe more clearly ſhew, in plaine termes, the cheifeſt pointes of the Romane doctrine, denyed by Proteſtantes and Puritanes, then anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes doe declare, the true Catholique be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe againſt the Arians, Eunomians, Nouatians, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, and the like. As therefore diuers auncient Fathers and Doctors, haue, not onlie confuted the aduerſaries of truth, liuing in their owne time, and paſſed before them, but likewiſe haue taught, and explicated the reſidue of Chriſtian Religion: ſo we,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20968:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> according to our ſmaleſt talent, by gods gracious helpe, intende to make this ſummarie proofe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion, &amp; that by the only writen word of God, as a moſt firme and ſacred Anker of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, againſt al impugners thereof, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing other Proofes, yet acknowledg the eminent authority of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>15 For better ordering the whole work, we deuide<note place="margin">We folow the method of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmus ad Parachos. Diuiding the whole worke into four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and euerie part into ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Articles.</note> it into four partes, and euerie part, into manie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Articles: after the method of the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Catechiſme, directed to al Paſtors of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, by the ſpecial ordinance of the late holy Councel of Trent.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part, are contayned manie ſpecial Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, which are breefly compriſed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Crede. In the ſecond are proued, and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſeauen holie Sacraments; with the dread Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Catholique Church, inſtituted by Chriſt. In the third are declared, the ten Commaundements of God. And in the fourth part is ſhewed, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and efficacie of praier, eſpecially of our Lords praier, called the <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> And alſo of praiers publique and priuate.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20968:20"/> Teſtament which is Malachias, (for I wil not geue inſtance of other Bookes called into controuerſie) was written about the yeare of the world, three thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand, and fiue hundred: to witte, after the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods people, from their captiuitie in Babilon. In ſo much, that if the meanes of knowing true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be limited within the precinctes of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it was paſſing longe without this meanes, and yet longer before it was complete.</p>
               <p>4 Likewiſe there paſſed ſome yeares, after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church of Chriſt, by preaching, and propagation of the Goſpel in diuers nations, before<note place="margin">Neither was the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written preſently after Chriſtes Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention.</note> anie part of the new Teſtament was written. For S. Mathew writte the firſt part, about the eight yeare after our Sauiours Aſcenſion: And the laſt part was written by S. Iohn the Euangeliſt, nere three ſcore yeares after the firſt. This manifeſt truth conuinceth you of errour that ſay: Al doubtes in Religion, muſt be immediatly tried, and finally decided, by onely Scriptures. For needes you muſt firſt confeſſe, that<note place="margin">Before there were Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doubtes were decided by the Church.</note> before the holy Scriptures were written, there was ſome other ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meanes of trial, &amp; deciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doubt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful caſes. Secondly, you muſt tel vs, when that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer meanes ſeaſed, and this other of only Scriptures came in place. Whether ſo ſone as anie holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were extant, or not vntil ſome great part, half, or more, or al, were deliuered to the Church. If you ſay that before al was written, the reſt ſuffiſed for this purpoſe: then that which was written after, was needles: ſo the later Prophets in the old Teſtament, and S. Iohns Goſpel, with the Apocalipſe, are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or not neceſſary. If you ſay, that holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alone, did not ſuffice til al were written, then you muſt graunt, that al the time, betwene the firſt, and laſt writing of holie Scriptures, (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a thouſand yeares in the old Teſtament, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20968:21"/> threeſcore yeares in the new Teſtament) ſome other meanes was alſo neceſſarie together, with ſo much of them as was then written, to declare &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine queſtions riſing in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>5 But after that al were written &amp; publiſhed which<note place="margin">Some Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are now wanting which were ſometime extant.</note> now we haue, you wil ſay: They are the only trial of Chriſtian truthes, and are ſufficient without help of Traditions, or of interpretations, either of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, or the Church preſent. But that you may alſo ſee your weaknes in this euaſion, we demand of you, what ſupplie you haue of ſuch Scriptures as were once written, and are longe ſince periſhed. For there were ſome other partes of holie Scripture, which are not now in our Bible, as appeareth in the third Booke of Kinges, where it is written, that [Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon<note place="margin">3. Reg. 4. v. 32.</note> ſpake three thouſand Parables, and his ſonges were a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; fiue.

               <p>6 More particularly we require you to proue this aſſertion of youres by expreſſe holie Scripture, That al neceſſarie pointes of Chriſtian Faith and Religion, may be immediatly proued by onlie Scriptures. And that none other auctoritie is to be admitted.

But deduction of one truth from an other, is not here, nor elſwhere forbid. And whatſoeuer is deduced of the holie Scripture by the Church inſpired and aſſiſted by the holie Ghoſt, is Gods word, in that is the word of the holie Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>7 An other like place is, in the twelft Chapter of<note place="margin">The ſecond place.</note> the ſame booke [what I commaund thee, that only<note place="margin">Ch. 12. v. 32.</note> doe to our Lord: neither adde anie thing, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.] This is an admonition concerning Hoſtes to be offered in Sacrifices: commaunding, that al thoſe thinges ſhould be offered, which are preſcribed by the Law, &amp; prohibiting other kindes of thinges.

               <p>9 S. Paul alſo willeth his ſcholer S.

And if anie man ſhal diminiſh of the wordes of the Booke of this Propheſie: God ſhal take away his part out of the Booke of life, and out of the holie Citie, and of theſe thinges that be written in this Booke.]

For the ſame S. Iohn him ſelf, writte his Goſpel, after this Propheſie of the Apocalypſe: &amp; concludeth the ſame Goſpel thus. [But there are manie other thinges alſo that Ieſus did, which if they were written, in particular, neither the world it ſelf I thinke, were able to containe thoſe Bookes, that ſhould be written.] Thus much concerning thoſe holie Srriptures, which Proteſtantes commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce againſt the authoritie, &amp; vſe of Traditions.</p>

And in the written Law it was continued and confirmed by<note place="margin">Exo. 20. v. 8. 9. 10. 11.

(In Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomie) Obſerue the day of the Sabbath.] Alſo the maner of keping it holy, is largely deſcribed, &amp; the reaſon of it alleaged, from the firſt inſtitution.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20968:23"/> And ſcarce anie other Precept, is ſo oft inculcated in al the old Teſtament, as this of keping the Sabbath, that is, the ſeuenth day of the weeke, holie, and vacant from worke. Neuertheleſſe this ſeuenth and Sabbath day, is now a worke day, as the other fiue daies of the weeke ordinarilie are. And both the old Traditions of Patriarkes, and the old precept of Moyſes Law, are abrogated, without any expreſſe holie Scripture, for the omiſſion therof. Yet are al Chriſtians wel warranted herein, by Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to worke on Saturday, which is the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>12 And by the very ſame Tradition, the Sunday,<note place="margin">Sunday called our Lords day, kept holie day, by Ayoſtolical Tradition.</note> called the Dominical and our Lordes day, is made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<note place="margin">Mat. 28. v. 1.

Becauſe on this day (called by al the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, the Firſt of the Sabbath) our Lord roſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death. And it began firſt to be kept holie day in the Apoſtles time. For S. Paul calleth it, [the firſt of the Sabbath] in which Chriſtians aſſembled together. And ſo doth S. Luke cal it [the firſt of the Sabbath] when they were aſſembled to breake bread (that is to miniſter the bleſſed Sacrament.) And ſhortly after, being alreadie a holy day, it was called, our Lordes day. But the Iewes kepe the ſeuenth and Sabbath day ſtil, as is to be ſeene at Rome, Venice, Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Frankford, and wherſoeuer they dwel. And Proteſtantes receiue &amp; obſerue in their maner, both theſe Tradations, aſwel in working on Saturday, which is the Sabbath and ſeuenth day, as in abſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from worke on Sunday, which is not the laſt but the firſt day of the weeke, now called our Lordes day. And that there was a day ſo called, before al the Apoſtles were parted from this world, appeareth by S. Iohn, making mention therof, in the beginning of<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. v. 10.</note> the Apocalypſe, but no expreſſe mention is there, nor elſwhere in al the holie Scriptures, that Saturday is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20968:23"/> now a day of worke, nor that Sunday was made the holy day, both which we know and obſerue by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition.</p>
               <p>13 A third example we haue, in the obſeruation<note place="margin">What thinges were reputed cleane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, was knowne by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> of thinges reputed [Cleane, and vncleane.] God<note place="margin">Gen. 7. v. 2. 3.</note> commanded Noe to receiue into the Arke [of al beaſtes that are cleane, ſeuen and ſeuen, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, but of the beaſtes that are vncleane, two and two, male and female] either by Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it might be reuealed to his Anceſters, or els by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Noe knew this difference of cleane &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſtes, and from Noe to Moyſes, the ſame was knowen by Tradition.

[It hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to the Holie Ghoſt, &amp; to vs, to lay no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burden vpon you, then theſe neceſſarie thinges, that you abſtaine from thinges immolated to Idoles,<note place="margin">v. 29.</note> and bloud, and that which is ſtrangled, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] This prohibition of eating bloud and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled<note place="margin">Aſtinence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eating bloud of beaſtes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated by Tradition.</note> meates, (as puddinges, and rapets,) which were alſo forbid long before the written Law, in the daies<note place="margin">Gen. 9. v. 4.</note> of Noe, and renewed by the Apoſtles, as neceſſarie vnder the ſame tenure of wordes, with Idolatrie and fornication (which two, alwaies were, and are, gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinnes,) is ſince ſo euacuated, that now theſe meates are lawfullie eaten in due times, as other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are: And that by cuſtome and Tradition of the

And ſo S. Paul knowing, and mantaining it, not to be neceſſarie, nor in ſome perſons caſes and conueuient, auoucheth that [Titus, wheras he was a Gentile, was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled<note place="margin">Gal. 2. v. 11.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20968:24"/> other pointes of the old Law, were neither hurtful if they were obſerued, nor of them ſelues neceſſarie to be obſerued. [As God hath called euerie one<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. v. 18.</note> (ſaith he) ſo let him walke, and as in al Churches I teach. Is anie man called being circumciſed?

Of the firſt ſort of thinges vnknowne to man, God him ſelf geueth inſtance in the number of ſtarres, when he bleſſed Abraham, and promiſed him the like innumerable progenie ſaying: [Looke vp<note place="margin">Gen. 15. v. 5.</note> to heauen and number the ſtarres if thou canſt.

As for the innumerable iſſue of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, is not only moſt perfectly knowne to God euerie way: but further it pleaſed him to be called pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly [the God of Abraham.

It farre exceedeth mannes natural capacitie, perfectlie to know the nature of Angels, being pure ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, voide of al corporal mixture, and impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to our external ſenſes. The neareſt in likenes to them, are mennes ſoules, in that they alſo, are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtances, endued with reaſon, and free wil, immortal, and capable of eternal felicitie, or miſerie, as Angels firſt were. But this is one great difference, (beſides others) that ſoules haue a natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inclination, and deſire, to their proper bodies, wherof they are the eſſential formes. In ſo much, that neither the ſoule nor the bodie, ſeperated the one from the other, is perfect in their ſpecifical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither of them is a man, being ſeperated, but being actually vnited as matter and forme, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a reaſonable or rational perſon; wheras An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are naturally perfect, without al compoſition, for they are not, neither can be, the formes of anie bodie.</p>

[As by one man ſinne<note place="margin">Rom. 5. v. 13.</note> entred into this world, and by ſinne death: ſo vnto al men death did paſſe, in which al ſinned.] Which he confirmeth anſwearing to an obiection, that it might ſeme, there was no ſuch general ſinne in al men, ſeing before the Law, it did not ſo appeare in al; therfore he ſaith, [that alſo in that former time,<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> euen vnto the Law, ſinne was in the world; but ſinne was not imputed (or did not appeare) when the Law was not. But death (which is the effect of ſinne)<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> reigned from Adam vnto Moyſes; euen on them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſinned not, after the ſimilitude of the preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication of Adam] to witte on thoſe more iuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo, that did not actually tranſgreſſe as Adam had done, yet they died, becauſe they were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſinners.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20968:73"/> to come] ſignifying that as by the ſinne of Adam we al dye; ſo by the grace of Chriſt, al his children liue. 10 Touching the other effect, he addeth the great<note place="margin">The other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace by Chriſt.</note> difference, ſaying: [But not as the offence, ſo alſo<note place="margin">v. 15.</note> the gift.

I ſay of al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons created, becauſe Chriſt our Sauiour, is a Diuine Perſon Increated. Concerning therfore the former point, that ſhe is trulie the Mother of God, although it be not expreſly ſaid in the holie Scripture, that the B. Virgin is the Mother of God, as the heritike Neſtorius obiected: yet is it neceſſarily deduced from holie Scriptures; and the denial therof is condemned to be heritical, by the holie Epheſine Councel.

S. Paul alſo teſtifieth, that God was borne of the Iſſue of Dauid, ſaying [Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. v. 5. Ch. 1. v. 3.</note> who is aboue al thinges GOD, bleſſed for euer, was borne of the Iewes, according to the fleſh; &amp; of the ſeede of Dauid] which was by his Mother the B. Virgin. And therfore ſhe, of whom God was borne, is as properly called the MOTHER of GOD, as is ſaid, [God is borne of the Iewes.] Likewiſe S. Iohn ſaith expreſly [Ieſus is the Sonne of God: This<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 5. v. 5. 20. Article 17.</note> is the true God] which is alreadie declared by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other ſacred textes. Vpon al which premiſſes, is neceſſarily inferred, that the B. Virgin, being the Mother of Ieſus, who is God: is the Mother of God; euen as certeinly and demonſtratiuely, as it is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſhe is the Mother of Chriſt. For neither had Ieſus his annointing, or offices, of Prophet, King, and Preiſt, wherof he is called Chriſt, from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

An other<note place="margin">An other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; illurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point of faith.</note> example, though it doth not proue our purpoſe, yet to illuſtrate this truth, is in a Queene, the wife of an abſolute King, bearing a Sonne, is trulie the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Prince. And when this Prince her Sonne cometh to be King, ſhe is trulie the mother of the King. And it were too nice, too preciſe, yea, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and falſe ſpeach, to ſay, ſhe is not mother of the king, but onlie of that man who is king, though he had not his kingdome by his mother. So the B. Virgin, bearing her Sonne Ieſus, who is Chriſt, &amp; who is alſo God: is no leſſe trulie the Mother of God, then ſhe is the Mother of Chriſt, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ieſus. Becauſe God, the moſt B. Trinitie, vouchſaifed to make her the Mother of Ieſus, who is Chriſt &amp; God.</p>

Which moſt ancient and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal doctrine of the Church, is grounded in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures. Iacob the holie Patriarch formed a<note place="margin">The Croſſe was preſigured in the old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.</note> Croſſe by laying his handes vpon the heades of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeps two ſonnes, the one arme croſſing the other. For when Ioſeph had ſet his elder ſonne to the right hand of Iacob, and his yonger ſonne to the left hand; [Iacob chaunging handes, put his right hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yonger, and his left hand vpon the elder] and that wittingly, contrarie to Ioſephs minde, becauſe his bleſſing geuen to thoſe children was myſtical, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying not only that the yonger of thoſe bretheren ſhould be preferred before the elder, but alſo that in time of grace and new teſtament, the Gentils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yonger people of God, ſhould excel the Iewes; which ſhould be effected by our Sauiour Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon a Croſſe. Otherwiſe if Iacob would not haue repreſented the Croſſe, he might either haue laide his right hand firſt vpon one, and then on the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20968:116"/> other, or els haue cauſed them to change places. It is true that the miſtical ſenſe doth not alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratiuely proue that thing which is otherwiſe doubtful: yet it doth wel illuſtrate, and make that more credible which is more obſcure in Chriſtan Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And that the croſſing of Iacobs armes ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly done, was myſtical, is confeſſed by al Diuines, and al Cotholiques generally vnderſtand it to be a myſterie of the Croſſe of Chriſt. [The peece of<note place="margin">Exo 15. v. 25.</note> wood alſo which Moyſes by Gods commandement caſt into the bitter waters, werby they were made ſweete] doubtles was myſtical &amp; doth aptly reſemble the daylie benefites which we receiue by the holie vſe of the Croſſe, in Sacraments and other bleſſinges.

As for the braſen ſerpent, which hath no more reſemblance in it ſelf then the other thinges had: yet is propoſed for an example, and ſimilitude by our Sauiour, that [as Moyſes exalted the ſerpent in the deſert, ſo muſt the ſonne of man be exalted] to witte on the Croſſe.</p>

And albeit ſome men wilingly, for Goddes cauſe, ſuſteyned the ſame kind of death, as S Peter, S.

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:20968:121"/> for this verie cauſe, is exalted infinitly, aboue al others.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20968:124"/> very early. So that it ſemeth there was nomore time betwene his death and Reſurrection, but one whole day, &amp; ſmale partes of other two dayes, with only two whole nightes (which we cal, Friday night, and Saturday night, &amp; no part at al of a third night.

Then we anſwere, that the ſpace of time on Friday betwene our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours death, and the night folowing, by Sinecdoche, was the firſt day of the three dayes: the firſt half of night folowing belonging to Friday, was the firſt night of the three nightes; the other half from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night forward, belonging to Saturday, was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the ſecond night, to which ſucceded the ſecond artificial day; &amp; the former part of night, which was til midnight, perteyning alſo to Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, did make the ſecond night complete; then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> midnight forwardes perteyning to Sunday, was therfore the third night, counting part for the whole.

And when they had done this, they incloſed a very great multitude of fiſhes, and their nette was broken.

And Ieſus ſaid to Simon, feare not; from this time now, thou ſhalt be taking men.] Is it not cleare in this narration of S. Luke, that there being two ſhippes, our Sauiour (al whoſe actions are our inſtructions) made choice to preach in that which was Simons, making vſe alſo of the other, to helpe Simon in the great draught of fiſhes, that he bade Simon only, launch into the deepe? That Simon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falling on his knees, expreſly acknowledged our Lordes great worke, and his owne vnworthines? That al being aſtoniſhed, our Lord ſpake only to Simon, bidding him not feare? Foretelling him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the reſt, that he ſhould become a fiſher of men? wheras Iames, and Iohn, and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſhould become alſo fiſhers of men?

And which maketh the thing moſt aſſured, S.

S. Mathew ſaying: the firſt Simon,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. v. 2. Mar. 3. v. 14. 16. Luc. 6. v. 14. Io. 6. v. 8.</note> who is called Peter. S. Marke more expreſly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it to be done at that time, ſaith: [He (to witte Chriſt) made, that twelue ſhould be with him: and he gaue to Simon the name Peter.] S. Luke ſaith: He choſe twelue whom he made Apoſtles: Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon whom he ſurnamed Peter. S. Iohn alſo in his Goſpel ſufficiently ſheweth the preeminence of S. Peter, deſcribing S. Andrew by the title of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Luc. 6. v. 14.</note> brother ſaying: Andrew the brother of Simon Peter. And ſo doth S. Luke.</p>
               <p>7 Neither may we here omitte the miraculous<note place="margin">Chriſt gaue him power to walke on the waters.</note> walking of S, Peter vpon the waters graunted to him only, and ſure not without myſterie. For when<note place="margin">Mat. 14. v. 26. 27.</note> he with others ſayling in a boate, ſaw our Sauiour walke on the Sea, and thinking it to be a ghoſt, for feare cryed out. He ſaying to them: [Haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it is I, feare not: Peter ſaid; Lord if it be thou, bid me come to thee, vpon the waters. And he ſaid come: then Peter deſcending out of the boate, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon the water to come to Ieſus.] As therfore Chriſt by his walking vpon the ſea, as wel as vpon the land, ſhewed his power ouer the whole world: ſo it pleaſed him by this fact, to ſignifie that Peters Iuriſdiction ſhould be extended ouer al, by ſea and land. That alſo which immediatly foloweth in the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:20968:156"/> next wordes of S. Peters feare, ſeing the winde<note place="margin">v. 30. 31.</note> rough, and of his aſking and receiuing helpe from Chriſt, teacheth vs that notwithſtanding the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of gouerners, Chriſt our Sauiour holdeth them vp, and by them conſerueth his Church. We know right wel that Proteſtantes denie and contemne theſe proofes, and it is eaſie to denie, when they can not otherwiſe refute Catholique doctrine; but we vrge them to tel vs directly what other true ſenſe theſe ſpeaches, and factes can haue? Nedes they muſt grant, that al theſe thinges were done for ſpecial purpoſes, and written by the Euangeliſtes, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Chriſtian doctrine. And therefore we ioyne iſſue with them, that this is the true ſenſe which al Catholique writers auouch, rather then anie other which they can alleage to the contrarie.</p>

The time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching that our Sauiour would paſſe out of this world, for inſtruction of his Apoſtles concerning the forme of gouernment which he would ordeine, and leaue with them, for the ſtabilitie of his Church, he demanded of them, aſwel the peoples opinions, as their owne iudgements, whom they ſuppoſed him ſelf to be, ſaying: [Whom ſay men that the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne<note place="margin">Mat. 16. v. 13.</note> of man is?] they reporting the diuers brutes of the people, according to their imaginations; he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, demanded of his twelue Apoſtles [But whom<note place="margin" type="runSum">15.</note> doe you ſay that I am?

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:20968:157"/> behalf of them al (for al being demanded, he alone anſwered) Chriſt, not further requiring euerie ones particular anſwere, but proceding to his purpoſe, approued and commended Peters anſwer, ſaying: [Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-iona becauſe fleſh and<note place="margin">v. 17.</note> bloud hath not reuealed it to thee; but my Father which is in heauen. And I ſay to thee: That thou art<note place="margin" type="runSum">18.</note> Cephas, &amp; vpon this Cephas, wil I build my Church.] So is the Siriake, or Hebrew text. In Greeke and Latin, in theſe termes [Thou art Peter, and vpon this Peter] In Engliſh, tranſlating the wordes into their proper ſignification, we muſt ſay thus [Thou art a Rocke, and vpon this Rocke wil I build my Church.] In al languages, the demoſtratiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none <hi>this,</hi> hath necceſſarie relation to the word go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and can not be referred in right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to anie other thing, as Proteſtantes doe wraſt it, and abſurdly referre it to Chriſt himſelf, or to the faith of Peter, not to his perſon. For if our Sauiour had ſo meant, as they wil ſeme to imagine: then he would haue ſaid, vpon a Rocke, not vpon this Rocke. But he did not ſay ſo, and therfore it is cleare that he did not meane as they ſay, but he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly meant as he ſpake to his Apoſtle: Vpon that which thou art, wil I build my Church, for none can denie his wordes [thou art a Rocke, and vpon this Rocke wil I build my Church] And ſo in the next wordes, declareth the ſtabilitie of his Church being built vpon a Rocke: ſaying that [the gates of hel,<note place="margin" type="runSum">18.</note> (that is al the forces coming from hel) ſhal not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt it.]</p>

               <p>ALbeit the ſame places of holie Scripture<note place="margin">Some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, yet denie it to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes viſible.</note> which ſhew the Church to be perpetual, doe for the moſt part, proue alſo that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies viſible: neuertheleſſe, becauſe theſe two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are in them ſelues diſtinct, and manie thinges are perpetual, which are not viſible, and manie things viſible, and not perpetual: and eſpecially, becauſe our aduerſaries, ſuppoſing the Church may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, yet denie it to be alwaies viſible: we ſhal here recite ſome moe places of holie Scriptures which particularly proue this point of the Churches conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual viſibilitie, euen from the beginning to the end of the world. As for the firſt age before the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral floud, it is ſo cleare by the Catalogue of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. Ch. 6. v. 2.</note> with their manie families, and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous title of the ſonnes of God, that no learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doth denie it.</p>
               <p>2 The firſt doubt which they make, is for the time<note place="margin">The firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is, of the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Noe, &amp; Abraham, Our anſwear. Sem, Heber, Abraham, and manie others were inuiolate in faith.</note> betwene the death of Noe, and the parting of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham from Chaldea, into Chanaan, which time, by true calculation, was no more then the ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eight yeares. And as certaine it is, that the Church of God was there alſo viſible, and wel known in the world, not only to the members therof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſelues, but alſo to infidels which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them for profeſſing one God, and refuſing to ſerue Idols. For Abraham who was neuer corrupted<note place="margin">Gen. 11. v. 10. &amp;c. Ch. 12. v. 1.</note> in faith nor religion, was twentie ſeauen yeares of age when Noe dyed. Moreouer at the time of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams parting from his Countrie of Chaldea, where he had ſuffered perſecution for his faith, there were
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20968:186"/> manie of his progenitors the faithful ſeruantes of God yet liuing. Namely Sem (the firſt ſonne of Noe) and Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, Reu, Sarug, and Thare, the father of Abraham. Melchizedech was then alſo liuing in Chanaan, a Preiſt of God, and (as it is moſt probable) a Chananite; for that S. Paul ſaith [his<note place="margin">Heb. 7. v. 6.</note> generation is not numbred among Abrahams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.] By al which it is manifeſt, that the Church was then alſo viſible in theſe Patriarches, and their families. From which time it increaſed ſtil in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams familie, which was not ſmal: As it appeareth<note place="margin">Gen. 14. v. 14.</note> by his ſudden arming of three hundred eightene men of his owne houſhold, for an exploite when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued his Nephew Lot, with others out of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies handes. Neither can it be doubted but al theſe, beſides women and children, beleued rightly in one God, for that ſhortlie after, al the men of his houſe aſwel the home-bred, as the bought ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, and ſtrangers, were circumciſed together.<note place="margin" type="runSum">27.</note> After which time, the Church was more and more conſpicuous according to Goddes promiſe to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſaying [I wil make thy ſeede, as the duſt of the<note place="margin">Gen. 13. v. 16.</note> earth: if anie man be able to number the duſt of the earth, thy ſeede alſo he ſhal be able to number.] Which though S. Paul teacheth to be more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed in Chriſtians, then in the Iewes; more<note place="margin">Rom. 9. v. 7.</note> in the ſpiritual, then in the natural children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, yet it is alſo cleare, that manie of Abrahams iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, &amp; their families, rightly beleued in God.</p>
               <p>3 An other obiection is made by Proteſtantes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching<note place="margin" type="runSum">An other more common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, of the time of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> the time when Elias lamented the decay of Goddes faithful children ſaying [With zele haue I<note place="margin">3.

Abraham the holie great Patriarch, when his wife Sara was deade, performed an other office for her,<note place="margin">Funeral Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpiritual office from bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</note> diſtinct from burial, called her obſequies.

It is alſo manifeſt that Abraham did not then a new thing, but obſerued the accuſtomed rite, as appeareth by the maner of Moyſes narration of a thing knowen, and vſually practiſed ſaying: [after that Abraham was
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:20968:199"/> riſen vp from the funeral obſequies &amp;c.] So this text confirmeth the tradition of the Iewes, who to this day haue a ſolemne office, &amp; prayer for the dead.<note place="margin">Gen. 50. v. 4.

They were clenſed from al ſinne that ſeperated from God, and from the godlie ſocietie of the liuing fruictful members; from al ſinne, that ſpiritually killeth the ſoule; for which it is called mortal ſinne: yet he truly confeſſeth, that himſelf and others of his ſocietie had ſinnes, to witte, which diuide not from God, nor from the godlie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie; which onlie wound, and blemiſh the ſoule,<note place="margin">Euerie ſinne doth blemiſh, and wound the ſoule: but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one doth not kil the ſoule.</note> but kil not: and therefore are not mortal ſinnes, but are called venial, becauſe they are more eaſily remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and pardoned.

From which proofe is firmely deduced, that the eminent Antichriſt muſt be a ſingular man, diſtinct from al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antichriſtes, and that he is the head of them al, and al the reſt his members. Againe the proper name which Antichriſt ſhal haue, ſheweth that he ſhal be a ſingular man. For albeit the ſame is meruelous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and no mortal man can as yet tel, what this name ſhal be, yet S. Iohn hath plainly written, that it is comprehended [in the number of ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. v. 18.</note> ſixtie, ſixe] &amp; that [it is the number (&amp; name) of a man] not of an office, nor of manie men, but of one man. And withal hath foretold, that [no man <note place="margin" type="runSum">17.</note> ſhal be ſuffered to buy, or to ſel, but that hath the character, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name.] By which it wil alſo appeare, (when this prophecie ſhal be fulfilled) both what his name is, and by the ſame name, amongſt manie other ſignes concurring, Antichriſt ſhal be knowne, to al that ſhal not be wilfully blind.</p>
               <p>5 Now for proofe, &amp; explication of the next point, <note place="margin">That Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not yet come, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that ſhal come before him, with him, and ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</note> that Antichriſt is not hitherto come, we may obſerue, that as his comming, and extreme perſecution, ſhal be a ſigne that the end of the world ſhal then be nere at hand: for our Sauiour ſaith [Immediatly after the <note place="margin">Mat. 24. v. 29. 33.</note> tribulation of thoſe dayes, the ſunne ſhal be darkned &amp;c] and concluding faith: [when ye ſhal ſee theſe thinges, know ye that it is nigh, euen at the doares.] So our experience that the end of the world is not yet come, is a demonſtratiue ſigne that Antichriſt is not come manie hundred yeares ſince: according to
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:20968:240"/> the common opinion of Proteſtantes, who generally ſay, that he was reuealed aboue a thouſand yeares agoe, either in the time of S. Gregorie the great, or ſtreight after: about the ſix hundred yeare of Chriſt. But let vs alſo conſider of other ſignes, as <note place="margin">This world ſhal end ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Antichriſt.</note> wel coming before Antichriſt, as occurring together with him: which are alſo for moſt part, ſignes of the <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. v. 7.</note> nere approaching conſummation of the world. One <note place="margin">The Romaine Empyre ſhal be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed before Antichriſt come.</note> ſigne of them both, is by S. Paules doctrine, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Romane Empire, which, though much decaied, is not hitherto deſtroyed [nor (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) taken away.] For the plaine ſenſe of which miſtical wordes, ſeing S. Paul remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> [to that which he had told them before when he was with them] we alſo remitte the reader to other larger diſcourſes written of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <note place="margin">The Goſpel ſhal be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in al the earth.</note> An other ſigne which muſt come before the end <note place="margin">Mat. 24. v. 14.</note> of the world, our Sauiour foretelleth, that [his Goſpel of the kingdom, ſhal be preached to the whole world, for a teſtimonie to al Nations. and then ſhal come the conſummation.] And in the very next wordes <note place="margin">Abomination of deſolation ſhal be in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes time.</note> interpoſeth an other ſigne, nearer adioyned to the <note place="margin">15. 21.</note> end of the world: which is [<hi>the Abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi>] and extreme perſecution [ſuch as neuer was before, nor ſhal be after] which can be none other, then that which Antichriſt ſhal make. Wherupon is clearly gathered, that the preaching of Chriſtes Goſpel to al Nations, in the whole world, muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before Antichriſt come. Wheras therfore it is certaine, that in a great part of the world, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the general name of <hi>America;</hi> Chriſtes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is but very lately within theſe laſt hundred yeares firſt preached; neither is yet to this day preached in manie great kingdomes therof; it is hereby manifeſt that Antichriſt did neither come long ſince, nor is as yet come, at leaſt is not yet renealed. But when the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:20968:241"/> holie Goſpel ſhal be propagated in al the nations, in which hitherto it neuer yet was preached; then may the great Antichriſt be expected; and with him aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eth the horrible great perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deſcribed by the Prophets, by Chriſt him ſelf, &amp; his Apoſtles. 6 In the ſame time alſo of Antichriſtes tyranical<note place="margin">Enoch, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, ſhal preach in the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> reigne; Enoch and Elias ſhal come againe amongſt mortal men, reſiſt his moſt wicked doctrine, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the truth of Chriſtes Goſpel.

And ſo it is cleare, that Elias was not to come in his owne perſon, but in ſpirit, at our Sauiours firſt coming; &amp; that he is indeede to come in his owne perſon before the ſecond coming of our Lord. And that this ſhal be performed in the time of Antichriſt, is further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the teſtimonie of S.

<pb n="482" facs="tcp:20968:242"/> Whiles therfore, theſe two ſo ſpecial witneſſes, are not come into the world; neither is it poſſible that Antichriſt ſhould be come.</p>
               <p>7 More proofe of ſo cleare a thing, may indeede to reaſonable men ſeeme needeleſſe: but becauſe our aduerſaries are ſo peremptorie in auouching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie fiction, that he is come long ſince, &amp; yet reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, we preſſe them yet further to tel vs, and that by the auctoritie of holie Scriptures, by which only they pretend to trie, and decide al doubted in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how long he ſhal reigne, and what maner of end<note place="margin">Antichriſt ſhal reigne but a ſhort time.</note> he ſhal haue? The holie Scriptures to vs are plaine in this point, that he ſhal reigne a very ſhort time: but three yeares and a halfe, and then ſhal come to a moſt miſerable deſtruction in the ſight of the whole world.

So Moyſes ſaid to that Nation [In the later time, thou ſhalt returne<note place="margin">Deut. 4. v. 30. Iſ. 10. v. 22.</note> to the Lord thy God; and ſhalt heare his voice.
